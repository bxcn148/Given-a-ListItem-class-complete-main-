# Given-a-ListItem-class-complete-main-
Given a ListItem class, complete main()
Given a ListItem class, complete main() using the built-in list type to create a linked list called shoppingList. The program should read items from input (ending with -1), adding each item to shoppingList, and output each item in shoppingList using the PrintNodeData() function.

Ex. If the input is:

milk
bread
eggs
waffles
cereal
-1
the output is:

milk
bread
eggs
waffles
cereal

Given main(), complete the program to add people to a queue. The program should read in a list of people’s names including “You” (ending with -1), adding each person to the peopleInQueue queue. Then, remove each person from the queue until “You” is at the head of the queue. Include print statements as shown in the example below.

Ex. If the input is:

Zadie Smith
Tom Sawyer
You
Louisa Alcott
-1
the output is:

Welcome to the ticketing service…
You are number 3 in the queue.
Zadie Smith has purchased a ticket.
You are now number 2
Tom Sawyer has purchased a ticket.
You are now number 1
You can now purchase your ticket!
